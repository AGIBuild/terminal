# What is Windows Terminal?

The Windows Terminal is a new, modern, fast, efficient, powerful, and productive terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and WSL. Its main features include multiple tabs, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, a GPU accelerated text rendering engine, and custom themes, styles, and configurations.

## Accessibility

We want to make the Terminal experience more inclusive and address issues and feature requests from users who rely on assistive technology. A top priority for Terminal is to include robust support for accessibility, as you have today in the default command-line experience on Windows. Much of this work is already complete and it’s our highest priority to support assistive technology in the next update to the Microsoft Store. To follow progress, please follow this issue on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/634.

We’d love to listen to your feedback and understand what you would like to see us do to make your experience exceptional. Please file any new feature requests or issues on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/microsoft/terminal) and we’ll be happy to work with you!
