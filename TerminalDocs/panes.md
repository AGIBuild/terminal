# Panes in Windows Terminal

Panes give you the ability to run multiple command line applications next to each other within the same tab. This minimizes the need to switch between tabs and lets you see multiple prompts at once.

## Creating a new pane

You can either create a new vertical or horizontal pane in the Terminal. To create a new vertical pane of your default profile, you can type `Alt+Shift+Plus`. For a horizontal pane of your default profile, you can type `Alt+Shift+-`.

## Switching between panes

The Terminal allows you to navigate between panes by using the keyboard. If you hold the `Alt` key, you can use your arrow keys to move your focus between panes.

## Resizing a pane

You can adjust the size of your panes by holding `Alt+Shift` and using your arrow keys to resize the focused pane.

## Closing a pane

You can close the focused pane by typing `Ctrl+Shift+W`. If you only have one pane, `Ctrl+Shift+W` will close the whole Terminal.

## Customizing pane key bindings

- new pane with specific profile, startingDirectory, etc.
