# Tutorial: SSH in Windows Terminal

Windows 10 has a built-in SSH client that you can use in Windows Terminal.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a profile in Windows Terminal that uses SSH.

## Create a profile

You can start an SSH session in your command prompt by executing `ssh user@machine` and you will be prompted to enter your password. You can create a Windows Terminal profile that does this on startup by adding the `commandline` setting to a profile in your settings.json file.

```js
"commandline": "ssh cinnamon@roll"
```
