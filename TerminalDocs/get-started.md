# Install and set up Windows Terminal

## Installation

You can install the Windows Terminal from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal).

If you don't have access to the Microsoft Store, the builds are published on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases). If you install from GitHub, the Terminal will not automatically update with new versions.

## First run

After installation, when you open the Terminal, it will start with PowerShell as the default profile in the open tab.

## Open a new tab

You can open a new tab of the default profile by pressing `ctrl+shift+t` or by clicking the plus button. If you want to open a different profile, you can click the arrow next to the plus button to open the dropdown menu. From there, you can select which profile to open.

## Configuration

If you want to customize the settings of your Terminal, you can click on the settings button in the dropdown menu. This will open the settings.json file in your default JSON text editor. The application that opens is defined in your Windows OS settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any difficulties using the Terminal, reference the [Troubleshooting page](./troubleshooting.md). If you find any bugs or have a feature request, you can click the feedback link in the About menu of the Terminal to go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) where you can file a new issue.
